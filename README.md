# Stock-Prediction-using-Facebook-Prophet
In this project we will create a stock price prediction model using **Facebook Prophet**.

This project demonstrates how to build a stock price prediction model using Facebook Prophet, a powerful time-series forecasting tool developed by Meta.
Facebook Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool developed by the research team at Meta. It is specifically designed for forecasting time series data that exhibit patterns such as seasonality, holidays, and trends. </br>
Key Features of Facebook Prophet:

* Built-in support for daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality
* Handles holidays and special events with custom flexibility
* Simple to implement using Python or R
* Excellent for business forecasting such as sales, financial data, or website traffic </br>

We will use historical stock data of Tesla (TSLA) for this prediction model.

## üéØ Learning Objectives:
We are going to focus on three learning objectives:

1) Creating a Facebook Prophet Model & Forecasting the stock price of Tesla 30 days into the future
2) Data Visualization using Plotly express
3) Stock Analysis & Forecast evaluation using Google Finance in Google Sheets

## üìå Project Workflow:
The project on Tesla stock price prediction using Facebook Prophet is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Importing all the necessary libraries </br>
Task 2: Importing the dataset from Yahoo Finance </br>
Task 3: Data Visualization using Plotly express </br>
Task 4: Data Preparation & Modelling </br>
Task 5: Forecasting </br>
Task 6: Forecast Evaluation using Google Finance in Google Sheets</br>
Task 7: Conclusion-  Stock Analysis of Tesla using Yahoo Finance </br>
Task 8: Automating stock forecasting- for other stocks

## üìà Prediction Results & Conclusion

Using Facebook Prophet, we successfully forecasted the closing stock prices of **Tesla (TSLA)** for the next 30 days based on historical data.

The model captured the overall trend and produced a reasonable future estimate, which can serve as a foundational approach for more advanced financial forecasting.

### üîç Key Observations:
- The trend shows a gradual upward/downward movement according to historical data.
- The forecast also provides **confidence intervals** that help assess prediction reliability.
- The model can be fine-tuned with additional features like **holidays, custom seasonality, or external regressors** for improved accuracy.

Below is the graph generated from our model's prediction:
